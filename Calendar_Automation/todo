Currently it seems like schedule_appointments fails to parse the input properly
I've added a small fix search # TODO PLASTER: to find, feel free to remove it
with the fix we still fail to extract the date for some reason and keeps it in time delta from sunday date

also failure reason only seen in logs and not in console.

also we will need to add the condition, foreach customer c there are no two appointments in the same day
the customer id duplication was commented out, to find search #duplicate
